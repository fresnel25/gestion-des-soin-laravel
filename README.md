     - yourdomain.com/public/install

   - Now the installer will show up. The first screen will be the Welcome Screen.

   > Note: If you are not able to access the website by accessing yourdomain.com/install, but you are able to access it via yourdomain.com/index.php/install, this means that you probably don't have Apache mod_rewrite installed and enabled.
